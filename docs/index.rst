Welcome to FLINT-UI's documentation!
====================================

FLINT-UI is a web application which makes it easier for users to run
FLINT Docker and modules easily on their local device or through the
`FLINT Cloud API`_.

The main users of the FLINT are scientists, policymakers, forest
officers, GIS specialists, developers to name a few. This project
provides an easy to use web interface for scientists, policymakers, and
forest officers to solve issues around the technical setup and usage of
standard FLINT. This project is compatible with the FLINT Cloud API as
well, so that the user can manage their FLINT Cloud deployments.

This project also provides a base for governments to build their own
application on top of the FLINT. Every government possess a different
FLINT implementation, exclusive and custom modules and configuration,
and hence the tool can be customised for every module.
